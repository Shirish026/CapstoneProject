# IBM Data Science Capstone Project - SpaceX First Stage Landing Success
Welcome to my IBM data science capstone project! In this repository, you will find a collection of data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization tools and techniques that I have developed to find the most accurate launch parameters to get a high success rate of SpaceX first stage landing.

# Contents
* Data: This folder contains the raw and processed data sets that we used in our analysis.
* Notebooks: This folder contains Jupyter notebooks with our data exploration, modeling, and evaluation workflows.
* Scripts: This folder contains Python scripts that we used to pre-process and manipulate the data (Folium analysis).
* Presentation: This folder contains slides and materials from our presentation on the project.

# Dependencies
